# FFVideo Tool-Kit
A simple video tool kit used for trimming and merging videos. Built using JavaFX, FFMPEG and FFProbe for video info. You need FFMPEG and FFProbe installed as an environment variable for this to work.

## Features
* **Trimming:** Basic video trimming used to cut out a portion of a video with options to scale between 480p, 720p and 1080p and increase/decrease volume.

* **Cropping:** Basic video cropping used to crop out a specific area of a video.
